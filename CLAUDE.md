## Project Overview

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with Paperless-NGX document management system. It enables AI assistants like Claude to manage documents, tags, correspondents, and document types through the Paperless-NGX API.

**Tech Stack:**
- TypeScript with Node.js
- MCP SDK (@modelcontextprotocol/sdk)
- Express for HTTP transport mode
- Axios for API requests
- Zod for schema validation

## Build and Development Commands

### Essential Commands
- **Build:** `npm run build` - Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript in `build/` directory
- **Start:** `npm run start` - Run the server with ts-node (development)
- **Test:** `npm test` - Currently no tests defined (outputs error and exits)
- **Pack:** `npm run dxt-pack` - Package for DXT distribution
- **Inspect:** `npm run inspect` - Build and run with MCP inspector

### Running the Server
```bash
# STDIO mode (default)
npm run start -- --baseUrl http://localhost:8000 --token your-api-token

# HTTP mode
npm run start -- --baseUrl http://localhost:8000 --token your-api-token --http --port 3000

# Using environment variables
export PAPERLESS_URL=http://localhost:8000
export PAPERLESS_API_KEY=your-api-token
npm run start
```

## Code Style and Conventions

### TypeScript Standards
- **Strict mode enabled** - All strict type checking options are on
- **noImplicitAny: false** - Implicit any types are allowed
- **Target:** ES2016
- **Module:** CommonJS with Node resolution
- **Output:** `build/` directory with declaration files

### Code Patterns and Best Practices

1. **Tool registration with Zod validation and error handling** - All tools should follow this pattern:
   ```typescript
   server.tool(
     "tool_name",
     "Tool description explaining what it does",
     {
       param: z.string(),
       optional_param: z.number().optional()
     },
     withErrorHandling(async (args, extra) => {
       // Implementation
       return {
         content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(result) }]
       };
     })
   );
   ```

2. **API requests** - Use the PaperlessAPI class for all API interactions
   ```typescript
   const api = new PaperlessAPI(baseUrl, token);
   await api.request('/path', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(data) });
   ```

3. **Document enhancement** - Use `convertDocsWithNames()` from `src/api/documentEnhancer.ts` to enrich document responses with human-readable names for tags, correspondents, document types, and custom fields

4. **Empty value handling** - Use transformation utilities from `tools/utils/empty.ts`:
   - `arrayNotEmpty` - Converts empty arrays to undefined
   - `objectNotEmpty` - Converts empty objects to undefined

### Naming Conventions
- **Files:** camelCase for TypeScript files (e.g., `PaperlessAPI.ts`, `documentEnhancer.ts`)
- **Classes:** PascalCase (e.g., `PaperlessAPI`)
- **Functions:** camelCase (e.g., `registerDocumentTools`, `bulkEditDocuments`)
- **Constants:** camelCase with const (e.g., `resolvedBaseUrl`)
- **Types/Interfaces:** PascalCase (e.g., `Document`, `Tag`, `Correspondent`)

### MCP Tool Naming
- Tools use snake_case (e.g., `list_documents`, `bulk_edit_documents`, `create_tag`)
- Tool names should be descriptive and action-oriented

### Comments and Documentation
- Minimal inline comments - code should be self-documenting
- **Do not write comments that restate the code they precede.** If the next line is `if (!isAbsolute(path))`, do not add a comment saying "path must be absolute" - the code already says that. Comments must add information the code cannot convey (the *why*, a non-obvious constraint, a reference), never paraphrase the *what*.
- Prefer deleting a redundant comment over keeping it. When in doubt, leave it out.
- JSDoc comments for complex functions or API methods
- Tool descriptions must clearly explain critical behaviors (e.g., delete vs remove operations)
- Include warnings for destructive operations

## MCP Server Specific Guidelines

### Tool Registration
All tools must be registered in `src/index.ts` using dedicated registration functions:
```typescript
registerDocumentTools(server, api);
registerTagTools(server, api);
registerCorrespondentTools(server, api);
registerDocumentTypeTools(server, api);
registerCustomFieldTools(server, api);
```

### Transport Modes
The server supports three transport modes:
1. **STDIO** (default) - Standard input/output, for CLI integrations
2. **HTTP** - Streamable HTTP transport via Express (POST to `/mcp` endpoint)
3. **SSE** - Server-Sent Events via Express (GET to `/sse` endpoint, POST messages to `/messages?sessionId=<id>`)

### Critical Behaviors to Document
When creating or modifying tools, clearly distinguish:
- **REMOVE operations** - Affect only specified documents (e.g., `remove_tag`)
- **DELETE operations** - Permanently delete from entire system (e.g., `delete_tag`, `delete` method)
- Destructive operations should require confirmation parameter

## Security and Safety

### Never Touch
- **Do not modify:** `.github/workflows/` - CI/CD configurations
- **Do not commit:** Environment files (`.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*.local`)
- **Do not commit:** Build artifacts (`build/`, `dist/`, `*.dxt`)
- **Do not commit:** Dependencies (`node_modules/`)
- **Do not commit:** Scratch, process, or summary files generated while working - e.g. `REVIEW_SUMMARY.md`, `NOTES.md`, `CHANGES.md`, `PLAN.md`, `TODO.md`, or anything describing *what you did*. These belong in the PR description or commit message, never in the repository. Before committing, review the file list and exclude anything that is not part of the actual change.

### Do Not Add New Repo-Level Files Unasked
- Do not create new top-level / meta files such as `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, GitHub templates, or new docs unless the task explicitly asks for them. A feature PR should change only what the feature needs.
- If a change seems to warrant a new policy/meta file, raise it in the PR description and let a maintainer decide - do not add it silently.
- New runtime files (source, tests, fixtures) are expected; the constraint is about documentation and project-governance files that change the project's surface area.

### API Token Handling
- Tokens are passed via environment variables or CLI arguments
- Never hardcode API tokens in source code
- API token validation happens in `src/index.ts` at startup

### Destructive Operations
- Deletion tools must include confirmation parameters
- Provide clear warnings in tool descriptions
- Log errors with context but avoid exposing sensitive data

## Testing and Validation

### Current State
- No automated tests currently exist (`npm test` returns error)
- Manual testing via `npm run inspect` with MCP inspector
- Test against a real Paperless-NGX instance (use a test/development instance to avoid data corruption)

### When Adding Features
- Test all CRUD operations for new tools
- Verify Zod schema validation with invalid inputs
- Test both STDIO and HTTP transport modes
- Ensure error messages are clear and actionable

## Dependencies

### Production Dependencies
- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (^1.30.0) - MCP server implementation. 1.23.0 is the minimum that reads `zod/v4` shapes; below it they are silently dropped from the advertised `inputSchema`.
- `axios` (^1.9.0) - HTTP client for API requests
- `express` (^5.1.0) - HTTP server for HTTP transport mode
- `form-data` (^4.0.2) - Multipart form data for file uploads
- `typescript` (^5.8.3) - TypeScript compiler (Note: Listed as production dependency in this project)
- `zod` (~4.4.3) - Schema validation. **The pin is deliberate, do not widen it.** On the v4 path the SDK converts schemas with zod's own `toJSONSchema`, which emits `anyOf` for a nullable or union field; from 4.5.0 on it went back to collapsing unchecked ones into `"type": ["string", "null"]`, which strict MCP clients reject by dropping the whole tool (#138). `src/tools/schemaCompat.test.ts` fails if that form reappears.

### Development Dependencies
- `@anthropic-ai/dxt` (^0.2.6) - Distribution packaging
- `@changesets/cli` (^2.29.4) - Version management
- `@types/express` (^5.0.2) - TypeScript type definitions for Express
- `@types/node` (^22.15.17) - TypeScript type definitions for Node.js
- `ts-node` (^10.9.2) - TypeScript execution for development

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Tool
1. Add tool definition to appropriate file in `src/tools/`
2. Define Zod schema for parameters
3. Implement handler with `withErrorHandling` wrapper
4. Add corresponding API method in `PaperlessAPI` class if needed
5. Update types in `src/api/types.ts` if needed
6. Test with MCP inspector
7. **Create a changeset:** `npx changeset` (select `minor` for new features)

### Modifying API Client
1. Update method in `src/api/PaperlessAPI.ts`
2. Update type definitions in `src/api/types.ts`
3. Ensure error handling includes useful context
4. Maintain consistent request/response patterns
5. **Create a changeset:** `npx changeset` (select appropriate version bump type)

### Creating Changesets (Required for All Changes)

**IMPORTANT:** Every code change must include a changeset file to enable proper version management and changelog generation.

1. **Create a changeset** after making code changes:
   ```bash
   npx changeset
   ```

2. **Answer the prompts:**
   - Select the type of change:
     - `patch` - Bug fixes, small changes (0.0.X)
     - `minor` - New features, backward compatible (0.X.0)
     - `major` - Breaking changes (X.0.0)
   - Write a clear summary of your changes

3. **Commit the generated file:**
   - Changesets creates a `.changeset/[random-name].md` file
   - Commit this file along with your code changes
   - The file contains version bump info and your change description

4. **Changeset configuration:**
   - Located in `.changeset/config.json`
   - Base branch: `main`
   - Automated via GitHub Actions (see `.github/workflows/release.yml`)
   - On merge to main, changesets automatically:
     - Creates/updates a "Version Packages" PR
     - Updates package.json version
     - Updates CHANGELOG.md
     - Publishes to npm with provenance

### Publishing Updates
1. **Always create a changeset** for your changes: `npx changeset`
2. Build before publishing: `npm run build`
3. Package is auto-published via GitHub Actions when "Version Packages" PR is merged

## Code Review Guidelines (for AI reviewers)

When reviewing a pull request in this repository, enforce everything above. The maintainer has repeatedly had to flag the same issues by hand - catch them in review instead. In particular:

### Always Flag
1. **Stray files** - Any committed file that is not part of the feature: scratch/summary docs (`REVIEW_SUMMARY.md`, `NOTES.md`, etc.), build artifacts, dependencies, or env files. Ask why it is in the diff and recommend removal.
2. **Unsolicited meta files** - A new `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, GitHub template, or similar that the PR's stated goal did not call for. Ask "what is this file and does this PR need it?"
3. **Redundant comments** - Comments that merely restate the line(s) they precede (e.g. a "must be absolute" comment directly above `if (!isAbsolute(...))`). Recommend deleting them. Keep only comments that explain *why*.
4. **Missing changeset** - Any code change without a `.changeset/*.md` file (see the changeset section above).
5. **Schema vs. runtime drift** - MCP tool params validated in prose/description but not enforced in the Zod schema. Constraints (required/mutually-exclusive params, absolute paths, etc.) belong in the schema.
6. **Blocking I/O** - Synchronous `fs` calls (`readFileSync`, `existsSync`, `statSync`) in async handlers. Require the `fs/promises` equivalents.
7. **Path / security boundaries** - File-path inputs that are not validated as absolute, not confined to an allowlist, and not symlink-resolved with `fs.promises.realpath` before the allowlist check (`path.resolve` alone does NOT dereference symlinks).
8. **Placeholder tests** - Tests that `assert.ok(true)` or re-check local strings instead of driving the real handler/helper. Require assertions against actual thrown errors and actual arguments passed to the API.
9. **Scope creep beyond the stated goal** - Anything in the diff the PR's title and linked issue did not ask for: a second feature, unrelated hardening, an opportunistic refactor. Name the parts that belong in their own PR and ask for them to be dropped from this one.
10. **Unrequested public surface** - New CLI flags, environment variables, `manifest.json` config fields, or HTTP endpoints that no linked issue asked for. Each is permanent and has to be supported forever; ask where it was agreed.
11. **Changed defaults** - A modified default (bind address, timeout, API version, page size) breaks existing setups. Flag it even when the new value is safer, and require it be split into its own PR.
12. **Disproportionate implementation** - Hundreds of lines of validation, guards, or abstraction around a change whose core is a few lines. Also: the same rule enforced at two layers, options or injection points with a single caller, and error paths for states that cannot occur. Ask for the smallest version that solves the stated problem.
13. **Justification comments** - Multi-line comments arguing the case for the change, often citing a third-party library's internals or version numbers to pre-empt a reviewer. That reasoning belongs in the PR description, not the source. (Distinct from item 3: these are not redundant, they are load-bearing arguments in the wrong place.)
14. **Out-of-context leftovers** - Comments or identifiers not in English, references to another repository or to the contributor's own deployment, config that only makes sense in one environment. These indicate code carried in from elsewhere without review. Deliberate attribution in this project's own documentation is not this.

### Review Style
- **Start from the PR's stated goal.** Identify the few lines that actually implement it, then judge everything else in the diff against that: is it needed for this change, or is it a separate concern that arrived along for the ride? Correct code that nobody asked for is still a finding.
- Be specific and actionable: name the file/line and state the concrete change you want.
- Prefer the smallest correct fix. Do not request large refactors for a focused PR; if the change is architecturally significant, say so and defer to the maintainer.
- Verify each finding against the current code before raising it - do not flag issues that were already addressed in a later commit.
- Keep feedback concise. One clear comment per issue beats a wall of text.

## API Validation and Type Safety

### OpenAPI Specification Reference

The authoritative source for all API endpoints, request/response schemas, and validation rules is `Paperless_ngx_REST_API.yaml`. This OpenAPI 3.0.3 specification defines all endpoints and HTTP methods, request/response schemas and data types, required vs optional parameters, authentication requirements, and error response formats.

### Type Definitions

All TypeScript interfaces must be defined in `src/api/types.ts` and match the OpenAPI schema definitions exactly:

- **Pagination**: Use `PaginationResponse<T>` for list endpoints
- **Entity Types**: Define interfaces matching the API schema (e.g., `Tag`, `Document`, `Correspondent`)
- **Request Types**: Use `Partial<T>` for create/update operations
- **Response Types**: Extend `PaginationResponse<T>` for list responses

Validation rules:
1. **Schema Compliance**: All types must match OpenAPI schema definitions exactly
2. **Required Fields**: Mark required fields as non-optional in TypeScript
3. **Optional Fields**: Use `?` for optional fields, `| null` for nullable fields
4. **Enums**: Use union types for enum values defined in the API spec
5. **Nested Objects**: Define separate interfaces for complex nested structures

### API Implementation

The `src/api/PaperlessAPI.ts` class implements all API operations:

- **Base URL**: Always use `/api` prefix for all endpoints
- **Authentication**: Include `Authorization: Token ${token}` header
- **Content-Type**: Use `application/json` for JSON requests
- **Version**: Include `Accept: application/json; version=9` header (default; overridable via `PAPERLESS_API_VERSION`)
- **File Uploads**: Use `FormData` for multipart requests
- Use generic types for all API calls; return typed responses matching defined interfaces
- Check HTTP status codes and handle errors gracefully

### Validation Checklist

When adding or modifying endpoints:
1. Verify the endpoint exists in `Paperless_ngx_REST_API.yaml`
2. Add/update interfaces in `src/api/types.ts`
3. Implement the method in `src/api/PaperlessAPI.ts`
4. Add the corresponding MCP tool following patterns in `src/tools/`
5. Include proper error handling and validation
6. Verify against actual API responses

Common issues to watch for: missing required fields, type mismatches, wrong enum values, mishandled nullable fields, and non-ISO 8601 date formats.

## TypeScript Type Safety

### Avoid Using `any`

Never use `any` unless absolutely necessary. Prefer:
- Specific interfaces/types for API parameters, responses, and function signatures
- `Record<string, unknown>` for objects with unknown structure
- `unknown` for truly unknown types (including caught errors: `catch (error: unknown)`)
- Union types for multiple possible types

Instead of:

```typescript
let apiParameters: any = {};
```

Define an interface:

```typescript
interface ApiParameters {
  custom_fields?: Array<{
    field: number;
    value: string | number | boolean | null;
  }>;
  add_tags?: number[];
  remove_tags?: number[];
}

let apiParameters: ApiParameters = {};
```

- Define interfaces in `src/api/types.ts` and reuse existing types.
- Prefer explicit type annotations for arguments and return values, especially for exported functions and tool handlers.
- Use Zod schemas for runtime validation of tool arguments where applicable.

## MCP Server Patterns (Adding a Tool)

Follow the pattern in `src/tools/customFields.ts`:

```typescript
export function registerEntityTools(server: McpServer, api: PaperlessAPI) {
  server.tool(
    "list_entities",
    "Description with IMPORTANT notes about caching and efficiency",
    {
      // Zod schema for parameters
    },
    withErrorHandling(async (args, extra) => {
      // Implementation
    })
  );
}
```

### Parameter Validation
- Use Zod schemas for all parameters.
- **Prefer Zod schemas similar to the API** - keep tool inputs close to the API rather than adding reassignment logic in code.
- Include optional parameters with proper defaults; support filtering and pagination.
- Validate enum values against the API specification.

### Caching and Efficiency
- Fetch related entities upfront for name resolution and cache mappings for the session.
- Search locally before making additional API calls.
- Use large page sizes to reduce request counts.
- Note important efficiency considerations in tool descriptions and docs.

### Tool Categories
- **List**: `list_*` - paginated lists with filtering
- **Get**: `get_*` - single entity by ID
- **Create**: `create_*` - create new entities
- **Update**: `update_*` - update existing entities
- **Delete**: `delete_*` - delete entities
- **Bulk**: `bulk_edit_*` - bulk operations

## HTTP Transport Mode (`src/index.ts`)

- The server runs in HTTP mode with the `--http` CLI flag; otherwise it runs in stdio mode.
- In HTTP mode, `src/index.ts` starts an Express server and exposes the MCP API at `/mcp`.
- Each POST to `/mcp` creates a new `McpServer` and `StreamableHTTPServerTransport` for stateless, isolated handling.
- The port is set with `--port` (default: 3000). Express must be installed for HTTP mode.
